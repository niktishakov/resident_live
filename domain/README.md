## Domain Layer
This is the domain layer of the application. It contains the entities, repositories and use cases.

## Getting Started

1. Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  domain: 
    path: <path-to-domain>/domain
```

2. Run the build runner to generate the files:

```bash
dart run build_runner watch
```
